This repo contains simple workflows used to

1. Download data such as the raw reads, reference genomes, reference proteomes, reference annotations
2. Scripts to process the raw fastq file to count matrices
3. Scripts to run blastp to find reciprocal bast hits between each species and a chosen reference (canine or human)

Everything (subdirectories, bash scripts, or python scripts) is numerically prefixed to indicate the order in which the scripts should be run.
